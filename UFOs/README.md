# UFO Sightings in the United States

*[Josiah Davis](http://josiahjdavis.com/) and I had a lot of fun writing this article together. We are especially grateful to the National UFO Reporting Center. We're skeptics, but we still appreciate the hard work that made this possible.*

Aliens exist.

This is clear from the extensive body of anecdotal evidence supporting the existence of extra-terrestrial beings. Consider this account from Prescott, Arizona on March 19, 1997:
>While doing astrophotography I observed five yellow-white lights in a "V" formation moving slowly from the northwest, across the sky to the northeast, then turn almost due south and continue until out of sight…During the transit, one of the trailing lights moved up and joined the three and then dropped back to the trailing position. I estimated the three light "V" to cover about 0.5 degrees of sky and the whole group of five lights to cover about 1 degree of sky.

This detailed account is one of over 80,000 documented by the [National UFO Reporting Center (NUFORC)]( http://www.nuforc.org/). According to its website, NUFORC’s mission is: to "receive, record, and to the greatest degree possible, corroborate and document reports from individuals who have been witness to unusual, possibly UFO-related events." To this end, the center relies on individuals to submit reports of UFO sightings. Many do so directly and many more are referred by the Federal Aviation Administration, the National Weather Services, NASA, and 911 emergency dispatchers, all of whom regularly direct calls they receive about UFO sightings to the NUFORC.

The NUFORC maintains these reports in an [online database]( http://www.nuforc.org/webreports/ndxevent.html) available to the public. Examining this data can yield many interesting insights about aliens beyond their mere existence. Below are three such insights derived from reported sighting density across various partitions of time. 

In short: certain alien preferences are curiously human. 

## Aliens Are Fans of the X-Files

In September 1993, the cult television show [The X-Files]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X-Files) premiered. 12 million people--about 5% of the US population at the time—watched the premier and 27 million watched during the show’s peak in 1997.  It is likely that these numbers are low, as they only count human viewership.

The main storyline of the show follows the interactions between extra-terrestrials and FBI Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. Aliens are a natural extension of the show’s target demographic. While Nielsen ratings for [Kepler 438b]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler-438b) are not yet available, the record clearly shows a statistically significant structural-break in the number of reported sightings in 1993. Much like [Downton Abbey fans]( http://www.salon.com/2012/01/27/is_it_ok_to_steal_downton_abbey/) today, aliens go to the source rather than wait to see each new season.

## Aliens Work Hard, Party Hard 

The 24-hour day and the 7-day week only make sense on Earth, so one would not necessarily expect UFO activity to follow a daily or a weekly pattern. Yet, this is exactly what one finds in the data: On any day of the week, UFO activity peaks between 6:00 PM and midnight. Furthermore, activity tends to be concentrated on weekends with Saturday night being the most popular and Monday the least.

This schedule only makes sense if alien activity follows some human activity. Given the bias towards the evening and the weekend, one can infer that the activity that aliens are interested in occurs during human leisure time. In other words, peak-UFO activity seems to occur at the same time as peak-college-fraternity-drinking activity. Because correlation implies causation, we can finally explain why UFOs that cross light years [crash as soon as they get to New Mexico]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident).

## Aliens Love America, Fireworks, Not Blowing Up D.C.

The movie [Independence Day]( http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116629/) is slander and its director, [Roland Emmerich](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000386/?ref_=tt_ov_dr), is a hack. Aliens do not intend to conquer us. They love America and they love the 4th of July.

Mr. Emmerich’s idea of aliens is a paranoid delusion and he should be ashamed. Aliens visit earth every 4th of July to see the fireworks and eat hot dogs. The chart above shows this: In any given year, aliens are more likely to visit the earth on the 4th of July than any other day. And what else besides fireworks, hotdogs, and one terrible movie is that day known for? Also, the White House is not a pile of charred glass, suggesting aliens are mainly here for the celebration.

## What Other Truths are Out There?

Aliens have other interests on Earth, which continued observation may help us to uncover. For example, the data also hints that aliens may come to earth to see the aurora borealis and the Leonid meteor shower or even to race experimental military aircraft. More years of observation are necessary and we sincerely hope NUFORC continues to archive these sightings. Even for skeptics, the insight it gives into human behavior is interesting.
