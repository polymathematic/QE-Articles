# Jevon's Paradox Today

*This piece was originally published on on the blog, Questionable Economics. It is included here as part of a selection of my favorite posts from that site.*

[Jevons’ Paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) refers to the economic circumstances that cause total demand for a resource to rise in spite of advances in the efficient use of that resource. One would expect greater efficiency to lead to lower consumption, but it can sometimes mean more.

## What is Jevons' Paradox?
 
Jevons’ Paradox is named for the British economist [William Stanley Jevons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Stanley_Jevons) who argued in 1865 that the coal industry was on an unsustainable trajectory. In his book, [“The Coal Question”](http://www.econlib.org/library/YPDBooks/Jevons/jvnCQ.html) Jevons, observed that in the decades since the invention of [Watt’s steam engine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt_steam_engine) demand for coal outpaced growth in the population. This was despite the fact that Watt's engine and those that succeeded it, produced energy from coal more and more efficiently. Extrapolating this trend, Jevons concluded that demand for coal would eventually exhaust the ability to produce it, a fact with a troubling implication: Long-term prosperity cannot be guaranteed by advances in efficiency alone.
  
To understand this counterintuitive finding, realize that any increase in efficiency necessarily makes coal necessarily cheaper. Even at a constant cost the amount of work that could be obtained from a set amount of coal must increase. Alternatively, increased efficiency means less coal is required to obtain a set amount of work.

As energy derived from coal became cheaper during the 19th century, England found additional applications for it. Steam engines displaced other energy sources--mainly windmills, charcoal, and horses--in many existing industries such as textiles. Completely new applications such as public gas lamps in London developed. And perhaps most importantly, cheaper coal meant more mines could be operated profitably, thereby making coal even cheaper:
 
>It was asserted that mines formerly drowned out and abandoned might sometimes, when coal was very cheap, be profitably drained by his rude atmospheric engine. But when Brindley went to Wolverhampton, to inspect one of these engines, he formed the opinion "that, unless the consumption of coal could be reduced, the extended use of this steam-engine was not practicable, by reason of its dearness, as compared with the power of horses, wind, or air.

Today, this coal-powered feedback loop is known as a large part of the Industrial Revolution.
 
Jevons saw this trend as unsustainable. Extrapolating from 83.6 million tons of coal raised from mines in the UK in 1861, he estimated that by 1961 UK coal consumption would stand at 2.6 billion tons per year. This is an incredible estimate, roughly equivalent to [actual coal production for the entire world in 1960](http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:329110/FULLTEXT01.pdf). Given the population of the UK at the time, this estimate adjusts to 50 tons per person. Put in one place, this amount of coal would create a pile over 30 meters wide at its base. Actual 1961 per capita coal production in the UK [was 3.7 tons per person](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/historical-coal-data-coal-production-availability-and-consumption-1853-to-2011), a number very close to the same statistic in Jevons’ time.

Actual coal consumption in the UK [peaked in the 1950s and has decreased ever since](http://www.carbonbrief.org/blog/2015/01/uk-coal-use-to-fall-to-lowest-level-since-industrial-revolution/). This is due to laws like the [Clean Air Act of 1956](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_Air_Act_1956), banning certain uses of coal, and the increased adoption of alternate energy sources, particularly nuclear power and natural gas from the North Sea. 
 
While peak coal came and went without triggering a [Malthusean Catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Malthusian_catastrophe), it is not clear that Jevons was wrong. Without legislative intervention and the discovery of new sources of energy to exploit, the growth in coal consumption may have continued unabated. Increased efficiency may or may not have had much, if anything, to with ultimately decreasing total demand for coal. Does this mean increased efficiency pointless then for ecological purposes?

It depends.
 
## A Modern Test of Jevons’ Paradox

Consider gasoline consumption in the United States. In the last 40 years the fuel efficiency of vehicles in the US and per capita consumption demonstrate a negative relationship. This has occurred without any significant legislation, mandating increases in fuel economy ([CAFE standards](http://www.nhtsa.gov/fuel-economy) remained fixed for most of this period) and without any viable alternatives to gasoline. In other words, trends in gasoline consumption seem to pair real increases in efficiency with real decreases in consumption.

Part of the reason for this negative relationship is the fact that price has a strong influence on both of these variables. When fuel is expensive drivers prefer more efficient cars and pocket the extra savings. When fuel is cheap, drivers’ preferences shift away from fuel economy. An extreme example of this is the H1, [an over-engineered military-grade vehicle](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Hummer_H1), sold to civilians during the mid-90s fuel price nadir.
 
What Americans do not change based on the price of gas is how many miles they drive. In recent decades, consumers in the United States tend to drive a relatively consistent amount [regardless of the price of gas](http://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.cfm?id=19191). Driving is something Americans do by necessity, and there are few incentives to drive any more or less than we already do.

If we stylize these facts, we can get a rough estimate of the degree to which increases in fuel efficiency are realized as fuel savings. Assuming Americans always drive a fixed number of miles in a given year and make predictable vehicle choices given the price of gas, analysis of the data estimates that a 10% increase in fuel efficiency results in about a 4% decrease in per-capita fuel consumption. It is worth noting that while these assumptions are simplistic, [more sophisticated analyses](http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-DP-13-19.pdf) concur that decreases in fuel consumption are always less than the corresponding increase in fuel efficiency.
 
That a 10% increase in fuel efficiency results in anything less than a 10% decrease in fuel consumption tells us that Jevons was at least partially correct: if gasoline or bituminous coal become more affordable, more of it will be consumed. Whether the magnitude of this demand rebound is greater than savings due to increased efficiency is a function of many factors such as preferences and the availability of close substitutes.

## Increases in efficiency are not everything

The benefits of getting more out of less are self-evident, but they do not address fundamental problems. Resources like coal and gasoline have large, unrealized social costs and their rate of consumption is disproportionately skewed towards the present. These market failures persist regardless of how efficiently a resource can be used.

What does help is legislation designed to correct specific market failures. These laws attempt to ensure that full social costs of any resource are explicitly allocated to those producing and consuming resources, rather than being borne by society as a whole. A basic form of this is the UK's Clean Air Act of 1956, which banned certain uses of coal. This law is credited with ending the recurrent [air pollution events in London](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Smog), and improving public health.

A more sophisticated approach is [Cap and Trade](http://www.edf.org/climate/how-cap-and-trade-works). This scheme, efficiently allocates pollution "credits" via auction. Firms choose between purchasing credits for the right to create a certain amount of pollution or investing in cleaner technologies. Either way, the hidden costs of resource consumption are made explicit based on willingness to pay. This approach is popular with economists, less so with politicians.

Jevons’ Paradox in a nutshell: Efficiency is good, but alone it does less than you'd think.
