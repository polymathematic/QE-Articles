# Can Red Mercury Save the World?

In February 2010, my platoon aided another group of U.S. soldiers and Iraqi Federal Police who had captured a smuggler's cache near Baghdad during a raid. My commander told me that they discovered a 6-inch long metal cylinder stamped “RED MERCURY” in the cache and that we needed to move it to another location. It was only after we had made the move that our Iraqi counterparts informed us us that they believed the material was for building nuclear weapons. They said this with complete sincerity.

Personally, I wished they had told me this before I had spent two hours travelling with it sitting next to me in a Humvee.

Later with the help of Wikipedia, I discovered that [red mercury](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_mercury) cannot be used for nuclear weapons or any other purpose. In fact, it does not seem to actually exist at all. By reputation, it is a powerful and much sought after substance that has uses in the production of fissionable materials or in the skin of stealth aircraft, and an indeterminate list of other applications. From my research, the exact properties of red mercury seem to vary depending on the needs of the one buying it and the imagination of the one selling it. It sounds ridiculous, but some people [seem convinced](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5176382.stm) it exists.

How can this fictitious substance save the world? By introducing information asymmetry into a dangerous market.

## What you don't know can help me

Economist [George Akerlof](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Akerlof) explains how the phemoninon of market failure to information asymmetry works in the [used car market](http://www.iei.liu.se/nek/730g83/artiklar/1.328833/AkerlofMarketforLemons.pdf). Cars are complex things, so there is a high degree of information asymmetry when buying one: the buyer usually has no way of knowing the quality and therefore the real value of the vehicle being sold. The seller does know, but has an incentive to conceal this information or even blatantly misrepresent it. A savvy buyer knows the seller's incentives and thus always suspects that there is a chance any given car could end up being a lemon.

Consider this scenario: A, a potential car buyer, will choose between one of two cars sold by B and C. A knows that one car, the plum,  is worth $15,000 and the other, the lemon, is  worth $5,000, but cannot determine what any specific car is worth. Accounting for the risk of picking the lemon, A offers both B and C $10,000, the average value for their vehicles. This gives A an equal chance of either gaining or losing $5,000 in the transaction. A is risk neutral, so this is an acceptable arrangement. 

B takes this deal: He owns the lemon and A’s offer is higher than if the true quality of the car was known. C refuses A’s offer for the opposite reason. In repeated iterations of this game, C may not even show up because he knows that he will not be offered a good price. The asymmetry of information between A, B, and C means that only lemons are sold in this stylized used car market.

The real world is more complicated. Used car quality varies continuously and across many dimensions. dividing cars into lemons and non-lemons is an imprecise science. Furthermore, unlike A, agents in real used car markets are not risk neutral. Cars are large investments and buyers tend to treat their purchase with considerable care. Like A, actual buyers reduce their offers based on lack of knowledge and perceived risk. 

## How does this work in the illicit materials market?

Continuous quality and buyer risk aversion can be [modeled](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~jdh1/micro%202/lectures/me34.htm) with a variation on the simple supply and demand model. In the model, the effects of asymmetric information are represented by a backward bending of the demand curve.

This chart has four demand curves and four possible market equilibria representing four states of information asymmetry. D<sub>0</sub> is a normal demand curve, which assumes both buyer and seller have perfect information. Under these assumptions, the market reaches equilibrium at point A. D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> represent situations in which information asymmetry exists, but still allows the market to clear at the less efficient points, C, B, and D. Interestingly, D<sub>1</sub> has two stable equilibrium points suggesting that shocks in the quality of goods available on the market can cause permanent changes in equilibrium price and quantity. D<sub>3</sub> represents the point at which the effect of the information asymmetry is severe enough to prevent all transactions.
 
The fact that some people believe that red mercury exists and have gone to [bizarre lengths](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-04-15/red-mercury-hoax-sparks-sewing-machine-frenzy/1650990) to obtain it, is one example of the information asymetry in the blackmarket for illicit nuclear materials. Another is the sale of [fake uranium](http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2014/08/bangladesh-uranium-sale-2014824144850414854.html) and [fabricated nuclear secrets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Merlin). All these are signs that this market does not clear efficiently. This is good, as the riskier potential buyers perceive the market, the less efficient it becomes. counting illegal transactions that do not occur is a difficult task, but this information asymmetry has likely prevented some transactions that would have put dangerous items into the hands of dangerous people.
